# HandsOn-DeepLearning

This repository shows common deep learning layers implemented from scratch. For better handling the activation functions like Sigmoid etc. are implemented as layers as well. I did not focus on computational efficiency and there might be small inconveniences. However, all layers are tested up to a certain point and the Neural Networks build with the components are able to learn!
